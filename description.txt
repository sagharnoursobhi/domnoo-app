we use some external libraries and google framework firefox to fetch data from backend.
Libraries: 1- I used vue-material card library to use card, side drawer, tabs.
2- I used vue-scroll-reveal to create animatied scroll

get request on browser :
https://domnoo-53917-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/users.json?orderBy="email"&&equalTo="francis@gmail.com"

=> if you want to make a query of a value in firefox for example user here, you should add index of that cuz by default
firefox does not get it

{
  "-LJVJNFaRnLVMW5mf83f": {
  "email": "francis@gmail.com"
  }
}

"users":{
    ".indexOn":["email"]
 }

 deploying site on production usong firefox: First of all we must install firebase tools globally.
 then use npm run build that create a dist folder containing all files compressed then
 1-firebase login
 2-firebase init => hosting
 3-we don't use public(default directory) so we must type dist
 4-Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? no
 5- File dist/index.html already exists. Overwrite? No(otherwise nth is gonna work)
 6-firebase deploy

 https://domnoo-53917.web.app(fake url to deploy your site)
